# Brews On The Bayou

This is my project for Flatiron's phase 5 project, built using React. 
It is a web application that let's users see a full list of craft breweries based in Louisiana. Users can read reviews left by other patrons, or leave one for others to see. 

## Starting Application 
 
 To start the application, please fork and clone the backend BEFORE starting the frontend. 

 Backend repository can be found here https://github.com/bclarke329/la-breweries-backend.

 Once backend repo has been cloned, start the rails server, and then start the frontend server by typing "npm start" in your terminal. 

 ### Technologies

 This application uses React with Redux to manage application state in one place with a Rails backend API. 

 ### Stretch Goals
- Incorporate logo images to each "show" page 
- Expand associations to also show the beers each brewery offers
- Allow users to leave reviews on beers 
- Search bar that allows users to find breweries by parish or city 
- incorporate user authentication, so users have a profile
